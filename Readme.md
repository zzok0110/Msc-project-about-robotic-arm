path: eDO\robots

1. Run start_up_surgery.m first.

2. Each .slx file need to change the path of Simscape models of eDO with the right mesh file first.

3. 'with_recover xxx.slx' are 3 desired force cases. 'error_all.slx' and 'for_plot.slx' are using to get diagrams.

4. 'pre_surgery_part.m' contains all testing code. The code needs to run in section.

Simulation takes time.
